      </h3>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>Today, when cloud and mobile devices are becoming ever so popular, and with the rapid development of the digital era, there is a dazzling array of development frameworks and cloud tools. However, many development models that rely on the conventional OS cannot react fast enough, thus making it difficult to increase the productivity of software development. In addition, with the development environments becoming increasingly more complicated, the design, installation, and induction of software are often done in ways that barely fit. Not only is it easy to make mistakes in every stage, the management also requires great effort.
        <br/>Because of the trends of the technology development, many of the application programs and tools have moved away from the desktop system based development model towards the web browser based design and execution. Facing today’s versatile mobile device platforms, different sized monitors, and even the lack of unified standards supported by various browsers, enterprises will definitely bear higher costs of technology R&D and maintenance, as well as higher risks. How can we make the tools adapt to the countless display methods? How should we consider the operating behaviors of users from the world at the same time? How can we help enterprises save development and maintenance costs? These are the most important tasks for developers.

        <strong>About us</strong>
      </h3>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>In view of the countless development problems facing many users, as well as the future trend of digital development, InfoChamp Systems Corporation (ICSC) was established in 2000. With its rich experiences in information services over the years and the excellent skills and knowledge of its professional staff, ICSC provides clients with excellent services of comprehensive information integration, automatic control, and enterprise planning for software applications. ICSC also built an EZo team with solid technical expertise and rich creativity. The EZo team developed EZo UIBuilder, EZoApp, and other cloud and mobile solutions using browsers as the platform, which enable rapid creation of web services and apps, dramatically lower technical threshold, and allow developers to focus on realizing functions and objectives without having to worry about the frustrating environment and lower level details. The characteristic of the product is reflected in its name: EZ (easy).
        <br/>Moreover, in addition to having the successful operation of ICSC as its backing, the EZo team also has the most advanced web development techniques and R&D information. The EZoApp that the team developed in recent years seamlessly integrates HTML5, jQuery Mobile and other newest techniques. It is a comprehensive mobile software development tool that can help individuals, organizations, and enterprises utilize networking and mobile technology, fully exercise their creativity, design their own diversified apps and application software, and create a win-win-win situation as well as a mutually beneficial cooperation model.
